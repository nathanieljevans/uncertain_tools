> Toolkit for evaluating probabilistic models with emphasis on model calibration and uncertainty quantification in `regression`

--- 


There are a number of ways to evaluate model calibration, sometimes called `prediction skill`, and we will approach two methods: 

- [Quantile calibration-curves](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kuleshov18a/kuleshov18a.pdf)

- [Distribution calibration](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/song19a/song19a.pdf)

- Platt scaling
- Isotonic regression
- Beta calibration
